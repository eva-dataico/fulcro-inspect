== Architecture

The Chrome and Electron versions of the app share the exact same UI code, but in both systems the UI code must
communicate with a separate background system.
We use fulcro-devtools-remote to abstract this away.

See Fulcro Devtool Remote for more details.

== Building

Building MacOS Electron releases is done as follows:

----
$ npm install
$ cd shells/electron
$ vi package.json     # Update version number
$ yarn
$ cd ../..
$ shadow-cljs release electron-main electron-renderer
$ cd shells/electron
$ electron-builder build -m
----

See the `Makefile` for other builds

== Chrome

First, make sure to update the version number in `shells/chrome/manifest.edn`.

Then build the zip file that can be uploaded to the Chrome store:

----
npm install
script/release-chrome
----

The result will be in a zip file in `releases`.
